## Overview
**taxRAG** is a powerful tax assistant built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, designed to help users generate accurate and insightful tax-related information. The project combines the power of web scraping, machine learning, and LangChainâ€™s RAG framework to deliver real-time tax insights through an intelligent chatbot interface.

## Key Features
- **RAG Pipeline with LangChain**: The core of this project is built on LangChain, which powers the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This allows the chatbot to provide precise and context-aware answers by retrieving relevant tax data and generating responses on the fly.
- **Data Sourced via Web Scraping**: Tax data is dynamically retrieved by scraping information from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) website (https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/), ensuring that the information provided is up-to-date and accurate.
- **Ollama's Command-R for Model Training**: The chatbot is powered by a model trained using Ollama's Command-R. This ensures that the tax assistant provides nuanced and highly relevant responses to user queries.
- **Custom Tax Reports**: Users can generate tailored tax reports based on the most recent data, making tax compliance easier for both individuals and businesses.

## Usage
This project is ideal for tax professionals, businesses, and individuals looking to streamline their tax-related processes. The chatbot interface allows users to ask specific tax questions and receive accurate, data-driven responses.
